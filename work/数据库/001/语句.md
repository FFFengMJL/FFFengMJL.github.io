1. 找出满足以下要求的销售区域，显示销售区域的号码（ID）和名字：销售区域的销售税小于0.1，且对应供货仓库的销售税大于0.18。

```postgresql
WITH warehouse AS (
    SELECT w_id 
    FROM bmsql_warehouse 
    WHERE w_tax > 0.18
)
SELECT d_id, d_name 
FROM bmsql_district, warehouse 
WHERE bmsql_district.d_w_id = warehouse.w_id
    AND d_tax < 0.1;
```

```postgresql
SELECT d_id, d_name 
FROM bmsql_district, bmsql_warehouse 
WHERE d_w_id = w_id
    AND d_tax < 0.1 
    AND w_tax > 0.18;
```

2. 找出满足下面要求的仓库名字（不输出重复的名字）： 有来自广东省（state为GD）且信用良好的顾客购买过该仓库的商品。

```pgsql
WITH history AS (
    WITH customer AS (
        SELECT c_id
        FROM bmsql_customer
        WHERE c_state = 'GD'
            AND c_credit = 'GC'
    )
    SELECT h_w_id
    FROM bmsql_history, customer
    WHERE h_c_id = customer.c_id
)
SELECT w_name
FROM bmsql_warehouse, history
WHERE w_id = history.h_w_id;
```

```pgsql
SELECT w_name
FROM bmsql_warehouse, bmsql_history, bmsql_customer
WHERE w_id = h_w_id
    AND c_state = 'GD'
    AND c_credit = 'GC'
    AND h_c_id = c_id;
```

3. 找出享有九折优惠但信用不良的顾客，显示他们的姓名（包括中间名）。

```pgsql
SELECT c_first, c_middle, c_last
FROM bmsql_customer
WHERE c_credit = 'BC'
    AND c_discount = 0.1;
```

4. 如果一种货物剩余的数量少于12，我们就认为该货物短缺。找出所有短缺的货物的名字，其所在仓库的名字，以及货物剩余的数量。

```pgsql
WITH stock AS(
    SELECT s_w_id, s_i_id, s_quantity
    FROM bmsql_stock
    WHERE s_quantity < 12
)
SELECT i_name, w_name, s_quantity
FROM bmsql_item, bmsql_warehouse, stock
WHERE w_id = s_w_id 
    AND i_id = s_i_id
ORDER BY i_id;
```

```pgsql
SELECT i_name, w_name, s_quantity
FROM bmsql_item, bmsql_warehouse, bmsql_stock
WHERE w_id = s_w_id 
    AND i_id = s_i_id
    AND s_quantity < 12
ORDER BY i_id;
```

5. 找出给广东销售区域供货的仓库都来自哪个省和城市。

```pgsql
WITH dist AS (
    SELECT d_w_id
    FROM bmsql_district
    WHERE d_state = 'GD'
)
SELECT w_state, w_city
FROM bmsql_warehouse, dist
WHERE w_id = d_w_id;
```

```pgsql
SELECT w_state, w_city
FROM bmsql_warehouse, bmsql_district
WHERE w_id = d_w_id
    AND d_state = 'GD'
```
